// This code defines a class called `Evaporator` with a single static method called `evaporator`. The `evaporator` method takes three parameters: `content`, `evap_per_day`, and `threshold`, all of which are of type `double`. 

// The purpose of the `evaporator` method is to calculate the number of days it takes for a liquid to completely evaporate given its initial content, the rate of evaporation per day, and a threshold percentage. 

// The method uses the `Math.Ceiling` function to round up the result of the calculation to the nearest integer. 

// The calculation itself is performed using the `Math.Log` function. The `Math.Log` function is used to calculate the natural logarithm of a number. In this case, it is used to calculate the natural logarithm of the ratio between the threshold and 100, divided by the ratio between the evaporation rate per day and 100. 

// The result of the calculation is then divided by the natural logarithm of 1 minus the evaporation rate per day divided by 100. 

// Finally, the result of the calculation is cast to an integer and returned as the result of the method.
